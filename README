"      Repetition of words is sign of bad style in most languages. This script
"      will help to track repetition of words in LaTeX, HTML and mail files.
"
"      LaTeX: don't take into account \keywords
"      HTML: don't highlight content of tags
"      Mail: don't look in quoted messages, headers and signatures 
"
"      There is also support for any other filetype. StyleChecker will
"      highlight there only repeated words in comments.
"
"      This script requires Perl interface. Theoretically it could be done in
"      pure VimL but multiple iterations through long lists of words make it
"      practically impossible - vote for arrays in VimL!
"
" Installation:
"      Put this file into your .vim/macros directory and source it from local
"      ftplugins. Of course you can place this file in .vim/plugin directory
"      but this file will be sourced every time you open Vim.
"
" Usage:
"      Default shorcut for style checking is ,, . You can change it by placing
"      in .vimrc: 
"            map <YourShortcut> <Plug>StyleChecker
"
"      After execution of map script will highlight repeated words.
"      Next execution of map restore original highlighting of file.
"      In console Vim offending words will be highlighted with 8 colors, in GUI
"      with 16. 
"      Thanks to Perl's pragma locale, language specific letters will be
"      treated properly. 
"
" Settings:
"      Behavior of StyleChecker you can control through variables. They are
"      Vim variables, there is no need to play with Perl.
" More about setting variables in file.
